  Maps of seagrass in two sites in the Auray River. These two sites were studied by Maxime Daviray during his PhD. Seagrass appeared very quickly during his PhD. This work aims to describe this rapid evolution of seagrasses.

# Materiel & Methods 
## Seagrass mapping using Sentinel-2

To map the seagrass extent over time, the Sentinel-2 constellation has been used. Level-2 images, which are already orthorectified and atmospherically corrected using Sen2Cor, have been downloaded using the Copernicus Platform [@Copernicus_Sentinel]. One low tide, cloud-free image per year, nearest to the period of maximum seagrass biomass at this latitude, has been used. The ICECREAM model (Davies et al., Accepted), a neural network classifier designed to identify and discriminate intertidal vegetation in Europe, has been applied to each Sentinel-2 image. Pixels of the Magnoliopsida class (seagrasses) have been isolated, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, @rouse1974monitoring), a commonly used remote sensing biomass proxy for vegetation, has been employed. NDVI values have then been transformed into Seagrass Percent Cover (SPC) using the equation from @zoffoli2021decadal [@eq-std]. SPC values below 20%, corresponding to low biomass pixels with a high risk of confusion with other vegetation classes, have been removed from the rest of the analysis.
