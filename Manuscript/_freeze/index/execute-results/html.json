Level-2 images, which are already orthorectified and atmospherically corrected using Sen2Cor, have been downloaded using the Copernicus Platform [@Copernicus_Sentinel]. One low tide, cloud-free image per year, nearest to the period of maximum seagrass biomass at this latitude, has been used. The ICECREAM model (Davies et al., Accepted), a neural network classifier designed to identify and discriminate intertidal vegetation in Europe, has been applied to each Sentinel-2 image. Pixels of the Magnoliopsida class (seagrasses) have been isolated, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, @rouse1974monitoring), a commonly used remote sensing biomass proxy for vegetation, has been employed. The equation of @zoffoli2021decadal have been used to transform  NDVI values into Seagrass Percent Cover [@eq-std]. SPC values below 20%, corresponding to low biomass pixel, with a high risk of confusion with other vegetation classes, have been remove from the rest of the analysis.\n\n$$\nSPC = 172.06*NDVI-22.18\n$$ {#eq-std}\n",
